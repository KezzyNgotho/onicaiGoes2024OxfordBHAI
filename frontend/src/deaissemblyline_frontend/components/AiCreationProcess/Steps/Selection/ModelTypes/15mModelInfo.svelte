    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">This is a small Large Language Model with 15 million parameters.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">It is smart enough to write children's stories in English for you (with the vocabulary of a 5 year old).</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Its specialization is writing stories which it does pretty well. It cannot do anything besides this.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">This model is part of the LLaMa family of Large Language Models which are open-source AI models created by Meta. They have the same internal structure ("architecture") but differ in size (number of parameters).</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300"><a href='https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer" class='underline'>Andrej Karpathy originally released this version</a> as an accessible entry point to work with Generative AI and <a href='https://github.com/icppWorld/icpp_llm' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer" class='underline'>Arjaan Buijk made it work</a> on the <a href='https://internetcomputer.org/' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer" class='underline dark:hover:text-blue-300'>Internet Computer</a>.</p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Good to know: this Large Language Model powered the first ever Generative AI app served from a blockchain (<a href='https://icgpt.icpp.world/' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer" class='underline'>ICGPT</a>).</p>
